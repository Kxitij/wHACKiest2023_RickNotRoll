#PROBLEM STATEMENT: Students at Ramaiah Institute of Technology lack a platform for connecting with peers who share similar interests and forming communities. Another problem faced by students is unfamiliarity with affordable dining options. A solution is needed to provide students with an easy and accessible way to find and join communities of like-minded individuals and to navigate good food options.


There is currently a lack of a centralized platform that allows individuals to easily discover and connect with like-minded individuals and communities, as well as providing nearby food options. This results in difficulty for people to find and join relevant groups and activities, and make food choices, leading to a lack of engagement and sense of belonging.
